# Advanced Car Parking Management System Powered by Deep Learning

![image](./carparkdetection.jpg)

This project is an advanced car parking management system that utilizes deep learning techniques to monitor and manage parking spaces. The system is powered by a VGG16 model to classify parking spaces as either "occupied" or "vacant". Additionally, OpenCV techniques are used for image cropping and annotation to manage and visualize parking space data.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet to classify parking spaces.
- **Image Cropping:** Employs OpenCV to crop images of parking spaces and save them for further analysis.
- **Interactive Annotation:** Allows users to interactively select and deselect parking space regions using mouse clicks.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses Pickle to save and load parking space positions and configurations.
